# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Thank you for your interest in the security of the ClusterLink project. We created this project with security in mind,
enabling technological communication across boundaries in the hybrid cloud.

We are in the alpha phase of this project and do not yet recommend using ClusterLink in production.
However, we would welcome your contributions to the code base and/or documentation including pointing
out potential security issues so that collectively we can create a solid, robust solution that continuously
improves. We review all proposed changes before incorporating them into the code base for the next version.
We cut versions monthly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you want to report a volnterability, you may either suggest a change directly to the code base through GitHub, or create
an issue on GitHub for others to address. When creating issues, you may report a bug, a feature enhancement, or what we
call "something else" if your issue does not fit into either of the other categories.

Thank you again for your interest in the security of our technology.
We welcome your comments, ideas, contributions, and feedback.
