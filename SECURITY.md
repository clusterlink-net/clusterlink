# Security policy

Thank you for your interest in the security of the ClusterLink project.
 We created this project with security in mind - enabling simple, performant
 **and** secure communication across boundaries in the hybrid cloud.

We are in the **alpha** phase of this project and do not yet recommend using
 ClusterLink in production. However, we would welcome your contributions to the
 code base and/or documentation including pointing out potential security issues
 so that collectively we can create a solid, robust solution that continuously
 improves.

## Security bulletins

For information regarding the security of this project please join the
 [users mailing list][].

## Reporting a vulnerability

We're extremely grateful for security researchers and users that report
 vulnerabilities to the ClusterLink Open Source Community. All reports
 are thoroughly investigated by a set of community volunteers.

We use [GitHub private vulnerability reporting][] for ClusterLink. Private vulnerability
 reporting provides an easy way for vulnerability reporters to privately disclose
 security risks to repository maintainers, within GitHub, and in a way that immediately
 notifies the repository maintainers of the issue.

You will receive a reply from one of the maintainers within a week, acknowledging receipt
 of the vulnerability report. You may be contacted to discuss the reported item further.
 Please bear with us as we seek to understand the breadth and scope of the reported
 problem, recreate it, and confirm if there is a vulnerability present.

### When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

- You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in ClusterLink
 components or features
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects ClusterLink
- You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that ClusterLink
 depends on. For projects with their own vulnerability reporting and disclosure
 process, please report the vulnerability directly there.

### When Should I NOT Report a Vulnerability?

- You need help tuning ClusterLink components for security (e.g., advice and help
 on setting access control policies for specific use cases)
- You need help applying security related updates
- Your issue is not security related
