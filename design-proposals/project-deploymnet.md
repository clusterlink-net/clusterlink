# Design Proposal: Project Deployment with Kubernetes Operator

**Author**: @kfirtoledo

**Status:** approved

## Summary/Abstract

The ClusterLink project allows the interconnection of various clusters within the same fabric. For each fabric, there is a fabric administrator responsible for determining which clusters can join the fabric, and a site administrator responsible for deploying ClusterLink to the Kubernetes (K8s) cluster.

This design proposal outlines the deployment process for the ClusterLink project on a Kubernetes cluster by the site administrator. It relies on a dedicated K8s operator to make the deployment more user-friendly, simplified, and native to K8s users.

## Background

### Motivation and problem space

This design proposal aims to simplify and enhance the deployment of the ClusterLink project.
By leveraging K8s native mechanisms, such as operators and CRDs, the objective is to establish a user-friendly deployment process.
Currently, ClusterLink deployment involves using the cl-adm CLI, which generates a large YAML file that contains the control plane and dataplane deployments, services, and RBAC configurations.
In the new design, this process will be managed by the ClusterLink operator, which has the following advantages:

* It consumes a simpler and more concise configuration in the form of a CRD.
* The use of CRD and the operator aids in automating deployment changes over time.
* The proposal differentiates between fabric and site administrators and provides a more secure deployment model via k8s RBAC.

### Impact and desired outcome

Implementing this proposal is expected to improve and simplify the deployment process for the ClusterLink users.
Aligning the deployment process with K8s standards will particularly benefit use cases involving central control management.

### Prior discussion and links

## User/User Story

The below user stories describe sample needs of a site administrator. Fabric administrators' requirements aren't elaborated.

1. As a site administrator, I want to join my cluster with an existing fabric. After receiving the credentials (e.g., fabric certificate and site keypair), I would like to provide minimal additional configuration needed to deploy ClusterLink to the site/cluster I manage.
1. As a site administrator, I would like to scale my ClusterLink deployment to meet growing demand (e.g., bandwidth) for cross-site communication.
1. As a site administrator, I would like to completely remove ClusterLink from my cluster, restoring its previous state.

## Goals

This design document should:

* Define the steps for deploying a ClusterLink gateway to a K8s cluster.
* Define the task functions of the ClusterLink deployment operator for setting up the ClusterLink components in the cluster.
* Define the CRD (Custom Resource Definition) for the ClusterLink deployment operator.

## Non-Goals

The following aspects are explicitly excluded and are out of scope in the current design:

* This document focuses only on the deployment of ClusterLink to the K8s cluster.
 The deployment to another environment, such as VMs, is out of scope.
* Security considerations related to the creation of certificates for the fabric or each site by the fabric administrator are also beyond the scope of this document.

## Proposal

The proposal describes how the ClusterLink project can be deployed on any K8s Cluster.
In this proposal, we distinguish between two entities:

1. Fabric administrator: manages the fabric and is responsible for determining which clusters can join the fabric.
1. Site administrator: manages the k8s Cluster and is responsible for deploying the ClusterLink into the cluster.

Before deploying the ClusterLink, a few prerequisite steps should be completed:

1. The fabric administrator should create the site certificate (public and private keys) and transfer them, along with the public CA certificate, to the site administrator.
2. The site administrator should deploy the certificates as Kubernetes secrets to the cluster. These secrets will have pre-defined names that are used by the ClusterLink components and will be deployed in the namespace where the ClusterLink component will be deployed (e.g., `clusterlink-system`). This namespace should be created in advance by the site administrator. This step can be automated to reduce operator workload and the chance of introducing errors.
3. The site administrator should deploy the ClusterLink operator to the cluster and register ClusterLink Custom Resource Definition (CRD) class to the cluster. This step is not dependent on the previous two and can be done at the administrator's convenience.

After completing all the prerequisites, the site administrator can edit and apply a ClusterLink CRD instance to the operator. The operator will then create the ClusterLink components in a pre-existing namespace as defined in the ClusterLink CRD, including:

* Deployment of ClusterLink controlplane components, including controlplane-pod, controlplane-service, and RBAC roles.
* Deployment of ClusterLink dataplane components, including dataplane pods (single or multiple) and the dataplane-service.
* Deployment of ClusterLink ingress, providing an external access point using load-balancer/node-port/gateway-API service.

Overall, the ClusterLink deployment stages are:

The ClusterLink operator will have privileged permissions, allowing it to create the ClusterLink components.
The ClusterLink components will be created in a pre-existed namespace (e.g `clusterlink-system`) , and the control-plane will have privileged permissions within the namespace and other namespaces for pod watching and service creation.
Additionally, the operator will create and update components in response to the CRD instance changes. Once created or updated, the operator will not actively monitor the state of each component (i.e., it will do a one-time reconciliation), assuming that any changes will be made only by privileged users.
Furthermore, the operator will delete all components and the namespace of ClusterLink when the CRD instance is deleted.
The ClusterLink deployment is limited to one instance per cluster. In the case of deploying more than one CRD instance, only the first one will be taken into account, and the others will be ignored and their Status shall be updated to reflect that.

The deployment file for the operator and example of CRD instance will be included in every project release.

The ClusterLink CLI will be utilized to automate the deployment process.
For instance, the following commands can assist the fabric administrator in creating the site certificates:

    clusterlink create fabric --name <fabric_name>
    clusterlink create site --name <site_name> --fabric <fabric_name> 

For the site administrator, automation of deploying the certificates as a secret to the cluster, deploying the ClusterLink operator, and the CRD instance can be achieved with:

    clusterlink install --site <site_name>

Note: The ClusterLink CLI uses the kubeconfig, and it should be set to the specific cluster that needs to be configured

### ClusterLink CRD

## Impacts / Key Questions

* Do we need the ClusterLink CLI? The only command that seems necessary is for fabric and peer certificates.
* Need to have a security discussion focusing on how and who deploys the peer and fabric certificates.

## Risks and Mitigations

Not applicable.

### Security Considerations

For the deployment of ClusterLink, the Fabric CA certificate (public key) and the peer certificates (public and private keys) must be provided. These certificates will be deployed to the cluster using k8s-secrets and should be handled by the cluster owner. The creation of these certificates can be performed by the central management, which is outside the scope of this document.

The ClusterLink operator will have privileged permissions to deploy the ClusterLink project to the cluster. The control plane of ClusterLink will be granted privileged access to all cluster resources through RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

In the future, we may introduce a per-Namespace deployment, which will have permissions limited to a single namespace.

## Implementation Details

The k8s operator will be built using the [Kubebuilder](https://kubebuilder.io/) tool, which allows easy building of k8s APIs and operators in Go.

### Testing Plan

There will be two types of tests:

1. Unit test: This test checks the operator's behavior and functionality, including the creation, updating, and deletion of ClusterLink components.
1. System-level test: This test checks the entire deployment process using CLI automation.

### Implementation Phases/History

The first phase focuses on building the k8s operator. In this step, we will create the ClusterLink operator and suitable tests. Additionally, during this step, we will continue to use the current cl-adm implementation to create peer and fabric certificates.
The `cl-adm create peer1` command will generate two files: `k8s-secret.yaml` (containing all the certificates for the control-plane and data-plane) and `clusterlink-system.yaml` (the CRD instance for the ClusterLink operator). The ClusterLink operator will be deployed manually by the site administrator. The site administrator deploys the `clusterlink-system.yaml` file to the ClusterLink operator, than the operator creates the ClusterLink components.

In the second step, the focus is on automating the deployment process. We will create a ClusterLink CLI. This CLI will automate certificate creation by the fabric administrator, replacing the current cl-adm CLI. Furthermore, the CLI will automate the deployment process for ClusterLink by the site manager (including secret creation, deploying the ClusterLink operator, and CRD creation).
